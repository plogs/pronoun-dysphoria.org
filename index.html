<h1>What is pronoun dysphoria?</h2>


<p><em>Pronoun dysphoria</em> is the condition typically associated
with persons who identify with the use of old school
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#Personal'>pronouns</a>
(e.g., he, she, them, they).</p>

<div style='margin-left: 2em; font-size: 80%'>

  <p>"What does that mean, <em>identify with</em>?"</p>

  <p>"It means some people see the world in a certain way. In a
  traditional way. Which is to say, old school pronouns are the
  pronouns that make sense, given their world view. The use of new
  style pronouns is abhorrent to the pronoun dysphoric."</p>

</div>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria'>Dysphoria</a>
can be a serious condition. Dysphoria means to be in a profound state
of unease or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>For example, "body integrity dysphoria" (or
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_dysphoria'>BID</a>)
is a mental disorder characterized by a desire to have a sensory or
physical disability or having discomfort with being able-bodied.
It typically begins in early adolescence and may result in harmful
consequences such as self-amputation. For example, one may desire to
lose a leg or to become blind or deaf.</p>

<p><em>Pronoun dysphoria</em> is not an extreme dysphoria like BID,
but the unease and dissatisfaction associated with the condition is
real and often painful.</p>

'gender recognition pins'</p>




<p>Because of this condition, the use of 
"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_gender_pronoun'>preferred
gender pronouns</a>" may cause pain to a person who identifies as
pronoun dysphoric. Also, the use of 'gender recognition pins' is
considered disrespectful.</p>
