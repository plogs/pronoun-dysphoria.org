<body>

<p>I'm an old-school-pronoun person.</p>

<p>My "identity" is tied to the use of traditional pronouns (e.g., he,
she, them, they). I can't explain why; that's just who I am.</p>

<p>The use of so-called "preferred pronouns" feels disturbingly wrong.
It causes anxiety. I feel bad inside. I guess you could say I have
pronoun dysphoria.</p>

<p>So please respect my point-of-view and refrain from inflicting harm
on me by insisting or even implying that I should act in a way
counter to my innermost sense of self.</p>
