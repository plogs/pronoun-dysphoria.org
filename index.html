<h1>What is pronoun dysphoria?</h2>


<p><em>Pronoun
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria'>dysphoria</a></em>
is the condition typically associated with
persons who identify with the use of old school
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#Personal'>pronouns</a>
(e.g., he, she, them, they).</p>

<p>Dysphoria can be a serious condition. Dysphoria means to be in a
profound state of unease or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>For example, "body integrity dysphoria" (or
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_dysphoria'>BID</a>)
is a mental
condition wherein an otherwise normal-bodied person <em>wants</em> to
be disabled in some way &mdash; such as amputating their leg or becoming
blind</p>

<p><em>Pronoun dysphoria</em> is not normally considered a mental
condition, although some sectors of society insist on labeling it as
such.</p>

<p>The use of so-called
"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_gender_pronoun'>preferred
gender pronouns</a>"
can be extremely painful and disorienting to a person with pronoun
dysphoria, because it feels disturbingly wrong.
Dysphorically wrong.
It makes them anxious. Makes them feel bad.</p>

'gender recognition pins'</p>

<p>The use of so-called 'gender recognition pins' is considered
disrespectful to people who identify as pronoun dysphoric, and in
extreme cases may cause mental harm.</p>
