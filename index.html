<h1>What is pronoun dysphoria?</h2>


<p><em>Pronoun dysphoria</em> is the condition typically associated
with persons who identify with the use of old school
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#Personal'>pronouns</a>
(e.g., he, she, them, they).</p>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria'>Dysphoria</a>
can be a serious condition. Dysphoria means to be in a profound state
of unease or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>For example, "body integrity dysphoria" (or
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_dysphoria'>BID</a>)
is a mental condition wherein an otherwise normal-bodied person
<em>wants</em> to be disabled in some way &mdash; such as amputating
their leg or becoming blind</p>

<p><em>Pronoun dysphoria</em> is not normally considered a mental
condition, although the unease and dissatisfaction associated with the
condition is real and often painful.</p>

'gender recognition pins'</p>




<p>The enforced use of 
"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_gender_pronoun'>preferred
gender pronouns</a>"
can be extremely painful to a person who experiences pronoun
dysphoria.</p>



<p>The use of 'gender recognition pins' is considered
disrespectful to people who identify as pronoun dysphoric.</p>
