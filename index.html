<h1>What is pronoun dysphoria?</h2>

<p>I'm an old school pronoun person.</p>

<p>My "identity" of who I am and what I should be is intimately tied
to the use of traditional
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun#Personal'>pronouns</a>
(e.g., he, she, them, they). I can't explain why; that's just who I
am.</p>

<p>Because I am the way that I am, the use of so-called
"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_gender_pronoun'>preferred gender pronouns</a>"
feels disturbingly wrong. It causes anxiety. I feel bad inside. Some
now call this condition <em>pronoun dysphoria</em>.
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria'>dysphoria</a> as in a
profound state of unease or dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Please respect who I am and refrain from inflicting harm by
insisting or even implying that I should act in a way contrary to my
innermost sense of self.</p>

When flaunted in the face<br>
of old school pronoun people,<br>
gender recognition pins<br>are considered<br>
disrespectful.</p>
